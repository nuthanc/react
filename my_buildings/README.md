* Diagram 3 and 4: App Overview and Hierarchy
* search-bar className is for our custom styling and ui segment is for everything within to be inside a box or rectangle
* In my implementation of ui segment, I had given that className to form instead of creating a div and stuffing all the other elements within it
* ui container within App.js is same as my implementation, i.e, the ui container and the SearchBar component within it
* searchTerm to term of Instructor's implementation, i.e, keeping the name short and meaningful
* if onChange prop is not present in input, then the input cannot be filled as it becomes read only
