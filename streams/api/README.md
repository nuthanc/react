# Streams API

### Initial Setup
* Inside api directory
* npm init and Enter for everything
* npm i json-server
* npmjs.com/package/json-server documentation
* Check db.json Example file
* Records automatically stored in db.json file

### Setting Up an API server
* db.json is like a database
* Delete "test" inside scripts of package.json and replace with "start"
* It's gonna start up json-server at port 3001 and watches any changes in db.json
* npm start
* That's the setup of API server
