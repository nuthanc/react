### App Overview
* npm install
* npm start

### Refactoring a Class to a Function
* Import useState and useEffect
* Define new functional component called App and cherry-pick from class based component
* [](empty array) meaning run only 1 time in useEffect
* Update setState and the states

### Extracting Reusable Logic
* Create useLocation.js inside src
* Put the state and effect logic there and return lat and errorMessage
* Import useLocation in index.js
